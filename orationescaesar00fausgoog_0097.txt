reservation, that his right to certain possessions in Galatia which
were claimed by other tetrarchs should be investigated in due time.
After the rapid march against Pharnaces ending in the victory of
Zela (August 2, 47), Caesar returned through Galatia, where he was
entertained by Deiot., and Bithynia, to the Province of Asia. He
proceeded to redistribute the Asiatic kingdoms: Deiot. lost the
tetrarchy of the Trocmi and the rule of Lesser Armenia in favour of
Mithradates of Pergamum and Ariobarzanes of Cappadocia respec-
tively ².

It was in Β. C. 45, two years after the visit of Caesar, that Deiot.
was accused by his own grandson Castor of having plotted the
murder of his illustrious guest on that occasion. We have alluded
to the fact that Deiot.’s reign over almost the whole of Galatia was
not undisputed. Moreover we have reason to believe that in his
domestic relations the king was cruel and suspicions. He had one
favourite son, his namesake and the heir-apparent: and, if we are to
believe Plutarch, had put his other sons to death ⁸. And subsequently,
in revenge for this accusation, he is said to have put to death his own
daughter and her husband, Castor the elder, in their city Gorbeus,

sent two embassies to Caesar, the first to Tarraco in Spain (5 38, also
