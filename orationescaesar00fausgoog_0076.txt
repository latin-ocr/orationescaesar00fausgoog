spirit had risen so high.’ Cp. ξ 1 supra in summa potestate.
ornamenta dignitatis, ‘the trappings of her pride ’z referring
to the vectigalia paid by the subjecta of Rome, and perhaps also to
temples and public works. (So de imp. Cn. Pomp. § 6 vectigalia are
called pacis ornamenta et subsidia belli, and in Leg. Agr. ii. ξ 80 the
same expressions are applied to the ager Campanus). The word
ornamentum often denotes ‘ outfit’ rather than ‘ornament.'

quae naturae debita pro patria est potissimum reddita. Natura here
=nature, as the course or order of things, rather than as the sum of
things: but it has both meanings, like Lucretius’ rerum natura.
Cp. ξ 27 naturam ipsam expleveris, ‘ the law of nature.’

audio, ‘ I will not listen to you! ’ (Wolf missing this force of the
word and making audirem=crederem, finds the words sels-con-
tradictory.)

fundamenta . . . quae cogitas, brachylogy for f. eorum operum
quae c. The expression is metaphoric-‚al ; but peculiarly appropriate
to Caesar’s projects, many of which (as the forum Iulium and the
temple of Venus· Genetrix) were wrought in stone and mortar.

Stoics, an indifference to external goods.

. parumne . . . ‘ Then, you will say, shall we be leaving behind· us

too small a work accomplished ? ’ Immo vero contradicts the real
sense of this (‘ Ι have done work enough ’), ‘ nay, but’: and this
is the common force of immo. Sometimes it corrects rather than
contradicts; Catil. i. ξ 2 vivit? immo vero in senatum venit, ‘ lives?
nay he comes into the senate,' where (so to speak) the pitch of the
previous statement is raised.
