NOTES: CHAP. Η. § 5-JV. ᾧ 10.

tum denique . . . reddere, si . . . dedisset: or. recta, tum
denique reddo si dedi. · -

vide, sq., apostrophe ε n. on 5 2. ut introd. dependent question. ᾧ 8.

qui . . . non dubitem, subj. of contrast after the relative (qui
=quamvis), as osten, but not invariably z the tendency to assimila-
tion of mood operates also here; so infra, dicerem (sense being
‘ when Ι shall speak ’). With this reading the sentence is ironical τ
‘ Ι who hesitate not to confess my own fault dare not, forsooth,
acknowledge that of L.’; the roal fact being (5 9) that it was no
fault to have been in Africa. But Quint. (v. 10, 93) reads de
Ligarii audeam dicere, and so also Codd. A H., ‘ I do not hesi-
tate to speak of what 1 did, and so Ι venture to say that L. was in
Africa.‘ ‹

propinquam cognationem, n. on 5 1 ε Cicero assumes an air
of patronage towards his young antagonist.

ad meum aliquem fructum, ‘that in the glor-y of a young
kinsman Ι have some degree of persoual interest.’ For the use of
the possessive pronoun ‘ profit to me‚' cp. tuo cum maximo malo,
and such phrases. V. Marc. ξ 22 n.

sed hoc quaero, breaking off and returning to the main subject 3 ᾧ 9.
‘ however my question is this! et ipse, like Ligarius. et certe,
emphasising (in Ligarius’ favour) one point of difference between the
career os Tubero and that of Ligarius. (Cicero ignores Thapsus. in
which surely Ligarius must have fought). The unusual phrasing
eontra Gaesarem (instead of cum) eniorces the thought.

aeie Pharsalica, the expression occurs for the first time here.
Quintilian notes four figures of speech in this passage: apostrophe,
metaphor (sensus armorum tuorum, ‘ the intention,’ personifying
the arms) ; rhetorical question, and its amplification by accumulatiora
(congeries or συναθροισμός) os synonymous words and thoughts
(Quint. ix. 2, 38: viii. 4, 27: viii. 6, 12 ε viii. 4, 26).

quae tua mens, etc„ ‘on what was your strong resolve, those
eyeS, that arm, that fiery spirit bent? ' So in Greek τίς, as in

τίνας ποθ’ ἔδρας τάσδε μοι omiss-tq

‘ what means this your suppliant session ? ’ Soph. Ο. T. 2.

hie, Caesar. Cp. n. on ξ 7 init. ᾧ 10.

eorum ipsorum, transposed to emphasise the ‘ argumentum ex
contrario!

quod esset, interrogative. The charge of Tubero is cited by
Quintilian as an instance of the ‘ genus turpe causarum.'

isto modo, ‘ as you have done.’ The reference to the second
person in iste can seldom be neglected in translating3 cp. infra
