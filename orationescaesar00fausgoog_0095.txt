PRO REGE DEIOTARO.

INTRODUc‘rloN.

‘ Oratiunculam pro Deiotaro, quam requirebas, habebam mecum,
quod non putaram ε itaque eam· tibi misi ι quam velim sic legas, ut
causam tenuem et inopem nec scriptione magno opere dag-nam. Sed
ego hospiti veteri et amico munusculum mittere volui levidense crasso
filo, cuiusmodi ipsius solent esse munera ’ (ad Fam. ix. 12).

5 1. The district of Galatia was peopled and named, in the third
century before the Christian era, by a horde of Celtic invaders who
swept across Europe in one of those waves of invasion which left
their mark on Roman history. Little need now be said about their
national character. Retaining the racc-characteristics of impulsive
valour and instability, they acquired, under Hellenic and afterwards
Roman influenceS, a degree of organisation, political and military,
which in spite of the attendant vices of a borrowed civilisation made
them a considerable power in Asia Minor.

5 a. The pro Rege Deiotaro illustrates, if it does not enlarge, our
knowledge of the Galatian character. The country had originally
been governed by numerous tetrarchs (as in Macedonian fashion its
princes were styled)‚ four to each of the three tribes of the original
stock ¹. But in one tribe at least these divided powers were by
degrees gathered up into a single rule z the one ruler retaining the
old title. Deiotarus was at first tetrarch of the Tolistoboii in West
Galatia, the district in which lay Blucium, afterwards (p. Deiot. 5 21)
his royal residence and Peium his treasury (ib. 5 17). He succeeded
to power at a time when the aggression of Mithradates VI of Pontus
threatened the independence of all the smaller kingdoms of Asia,
