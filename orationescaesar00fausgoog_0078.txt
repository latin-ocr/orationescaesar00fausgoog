PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO.

‘diuturnum quidem quicquam videtur in quo est aliquid extremum,
‘ nothing seems to me even so much as long, if it has an end
to it.’

quamquam, ‘ and yet,’ a mere particle of transition, introducing
a correction, or reservation from the previous statement. R. 22¹5·

illa, inquam, illa vita est tua: the usual order is illa illa in·
quam : v. 5 7 note and reff.

aeternitas, an equivalent for ‘eternity’ in most phrases: so Tusc.
i. 94 confer nostram longissimam aetatem cum aeternitate. But ‘ sor
all eternity ' is in perpetuum or in aeternum.

huic, sc. posterity to all time.

pugnas innumerabiles, incredibiles victoriae, a chiasmu5‚ or
‘ crossing’ of opposites. V. R. 5 1051, P.V. 5 438. 4.

munera, ‘largesses '3 cp. the technical meaning ‘a gladiatorial
show ’ as given by the aedile to the people3 v. Lewis and Short.

. nisi belli civffia incendium salute patriae ren-tinxerit ‘un-

less you stifle the smouldering remnants os civil war by the restora-
tion of your country’s liberties ἐ a bold metaphor: cp. pro Mur. 5 51
id (incendium) se non aqua sed ruina restincturum.

cupiditate, v. 5 13.

quidam, the Epicureans—and Caesar himself, if his speech in the
debate on the fate of the Catilinarian conspirators be historical—
‘ mortem cuncta mortalium mala dissolvere ; ultra neque curae neque
gaudio locum esse! Sall. Cat. li. Falso therefore was bracketed
by Weiske: it is too dogmatic for Cicer0, is inconsistent with the
fut. pertinebit, and calculated to offend Caesar.

voluntates, ‘ political leanings! Cp. with the whole passage
Lig. 5 19.

non enim . . . dissidebamus, ‘it was not merely a conflict of
policy and partisanship‚ but of drawn swords and opposing camps.'

obscuritas, ‘ perplexity’: cp. Lig. l. c. causa dubia. The word
has become subjective: cp. indignitas ‘ indignation,’ in Livy.-In
what follows, higher motives (duty, honour) are given in contrast
with lower (expediency, fear of consequences).

, eoadem, ‘ for that simple reason?

profudit: Hor. C. i. 12. 37 animaeque magnae prodigum Paullum.

qua-e enim . . . potest : this gives the reason for ille melior sit ε
better those who fought to the bitter end [the Pompeians in Africa]
than those who accepted Caesar’s pardon and then plotted against
him: ‘for what some people may consider in them obstinacy, others
<including themselves) may consider fidelity.’

fracta eat armis victoris, extincta est aequitate victoris.
