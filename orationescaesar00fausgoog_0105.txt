NOTES: CHAP. ‘Va § 16—VJJJ. 5 22.

cp. Phil. ii. 5 103 ipsum enim exspectare magnum fuit, ‘you sent to
Caesar at Alexandria: for you could not be expected to wait until
you could see him in person.’

oum in convivio comiter et· iucunde fuisses, ‘ had made
yourself most affable and pleasant at dinner.' So Cic. writes of ⁸

= Caesar’s behaviour as his own guest, Ο hospitem mihi tam gravem

ἅμεταμέλητονῑ fuit enim periucunde, ‘ my formidable guest left me
no regrets behind him; he was most agreeable ' (ad Att. xiii. 52).
Cp. libenter esse, ‘ to enjoy oneself,' impune esse, ‘to go unpunished.'

Attalus: a historical error: according to Livy (epit. 57) it was
Antiochus Sidetes of Syria. Such gifts to generals had usually been
kept a secret.

ad Numantiam: forthe exact sense v. R. 1111. 2: P.V. 330. 3:
for the ‘longa ferae bella Numantiae,' v. the history of the years
Β. C. 1 1 .

For {lie offining words cp. Phil. ii. 5 1153 pone . . . ante oeulos, ᾗ 20·
sc. tibi.

non video . . . acta. res criminoso est, ‘ I cannot see his (Deio- ᾧ 21.
tarus’) motive in changing the place for the attempt ε however the
proceedings of that time were, I admit, open to attack.’

vomere post. cenam, cp. Cic. ad Att. l.c. accubuit, ἐμετικὴν
agebat: itaque et edit et bibit ἀδεῶς et iucunde, ‘he sat down to
dinner3 and as he intended to take an emetic, he ate and drank to
his heart’s content, regardless of consequencesss Yet we know from
Suetonius that, for a Roman, Caesar was no glutton: he merely
adopted a recipe which all the doctors of the day recommended.
But the luxury of the later Romans constantly ran to grossness:
as Goethe says, they shewed the taste of parvenus in their pros·
perity. Cp. M. Arnold's splendid lines in ‘Obermann once more‚’
beginning ‘ On that hard Pagan world.’

perduint, like duint (Catil. i. 5 22) an optative form surviving in
a religions phrase t cp. δοῖεν. Edim, velim, nolim, malim, sim (old
siem) are similar forms·

habos crimina insidiarum, ‘there you have the charges re-
specting a plot.’ So Flacc. 5 49 habetis et honestatem hominis . .
et causam omnem simultatis,

dimitteret, mitteret, deliberative: R. 1610, K. 358, P.V. 384.

eoiret, fecisset, subj. os virtual or. obliqua: the physician being
the authority for the statement in each case. R. 1740, K. 469,
P.V. 399. Contrast habebat. above.
