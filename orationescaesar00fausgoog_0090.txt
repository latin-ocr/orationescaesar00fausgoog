PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO.

venistis ad Pompeium: strong instance of asyndeton adver·
sativum. ·

apud Gaesarem, ‘ at the bar of Caesar?

'a quo queramini prohibitos esse vos ==a quo, ut querimini,
prohibiti sitis, virtual or. obliqua, hence subj. Cp. the subj. mood of
the verbum dicendi in such a case as quod diceret (R. 1746).

gloriemini per me licet, lit. ‘ you are allowed to boast as far as Ι
am concerned ⁹ ε ‘ you have my leave to ’ : cp. use of per in Deiot. 5 37.
ᾗ 26. constantiam: the accuser declared, according to Quintilian,
‘ Ligarium perseverasse ’z but that he himself ‘ ut primum licuerit
a partibus recessisse!
quamvis . . . probarem, ‘ however much 1 approved ’ t a con-

patientia is ‘ endurance of the inevitable ’ or in a bad sense ‘ of

ut probo.
iusto, ‘ regular,' conferred with due formalities. A rhetorical

5 14² quiet se et causam laedi putet, ‘ who conceives himself and
the good cause affronted,’ a very concrete use.
ᾧ 28. ista, n. on 5 10.
