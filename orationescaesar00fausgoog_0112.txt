pressed historically in the perf. infin. : as here, esse iussum denoting
a single past fact, and 5 25 esse constitutOS, a completed act. Refer

Cp. n. on Lig. 5 30.

quocum mihi, etc„ ‘ to whom I am bound by a friendship
cemented by political considerations, a tie of hospitality contracted by
reciprocal inclination, an intimacy which is the growth os constant
intercourse, above all, by a bond os devotion created by his great
services to myself and my army ’ ε an ascending series.

semel, v. n. on 5 8: the idea is emphasised by the use of perf.
inf. pass. (completed action) after oportet. Cp. my n. on Cluent.
5 129: and R. 1371 d (RV. 381).

, nullius, n. on Marc. 5 4.

propono tibi ante oculos Marc. 5 5. For the co-ordination with

memoriam tuam: a remarkable memory is attributed to Caesar
in Lig. 5 35 and Phil. ii. 5 116 : and may be illustrated by the story

him of a trifling incident in his Spanish wars (Seneca, de benef. ν. 24),
he had sprained his ankle and was testing in a rough place on the
march, and the soldier had brought him water in his helmet.
