ωιθατῗίοῗῖε, gen. of definition, R. 1302, K 248, P. V. 143. Cp. the

well· known plea of Ovid—
caelestique viro quis me deceperit error
dicite, pro culpa ne scelus esse putet.

humani, apologetic. So in Ter. humanumst ⁴ it is a failing of
humanity.’

oum . . . conservavit, . . . induxit: the causal subj. (conserva-
verit) might have been used with cum. But the indic. construction
is far more forcible, identifying the acts ε ‘ in having preserved, he
has (apsosacto) introduced.’ So Deiot. 5 36, R. 1729 (Prof. Hale,
The cum-constructions, Part ii. p. 223, may very well be con-
sulted). Where dooe the apodosis begin?

quorum et fieqtientiam et dignitatem . . . videtis, ‘ whom you
see iu large numbers and iu full enjoyment of their dignities.’ Cp.
n. ou 5 10 illa auctoritas.

hostes, sc. patriae: ⁴ traitois.’ Thus Q. Ligarius was accused
before Caesar on what was virtually a charge of perduellio.

‘ purity of motives.' It is the discreditable aspect of spes (5 14).
So in 5 20 infra, Lig. 55 3, 17. The word may also mean (a) ‘ party

peace-proposaJS. ’

’.Ρ the general! So Cic. writes to P., ‘I do not complain that my

plan [viz. further negotiation] was not adopted: I followed yourS,
not in the cause of the Republic‚ of which Ι despaired . . . but 1
sought you, I wished to be with you’ (ad Att. viii. 11. 6).

grati animi fidelia memoria, ‘ a gratitude too loyal to forget!
Elsewhere he writeS‚ ⁶ I was afraid to fail Pompeius in his hour os need,
when he ona past occasion had not failed me in mine ' (ad Fam. vi. 6. 6).
