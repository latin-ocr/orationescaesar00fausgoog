PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO.

naturally turned once more to Cicero for his ‘advocacy3³ and its
effect upon the Dictator has been vividly described by Plutarch ¹3
how at first he assumed aq air os indifference to argument; but
how, as the orator proceeded, his colour came and went, and his
agitation increased, till at the mention of the battle of Pharsalus
his excitement caused him to drop some papers which he was
holding. It was a splendid triumph of sheer eloquence. Caesar
acquitted LigariUS, who shewed his gratitude only by joining the
conspiracy of Brutus and CassiuS, and finally fell a victim to the
proscription os B.c. 43. , ι

Of the three ‘ Caesarian Speeches ’ the pro Ligario seems to us to
stand highest as a masterpiece of art. The orator begins by steering

clear of the reefs which might have wrecked his case ε by admitting .

the charge and then with remorseless logic retorting it upon the
accuser himself. If Ligarius is guilty, Tubero is yet guiltier: not-
withstanding this, Tubero who has received a free pardon, would
fain have Ligarius punished with death. This gives Cicero an
opportunity both of pronouncing a spirited ‘apologia ’ for the Pom·-
peian party (Lig. §5 17, 18), and of contrasting the clemency of
Caesar with the cruelty of Tubero, A historiari of Rome has well
remarked, ‘Only a Cicero could have combined, under such trying
conditionS, the dignity and independence of the republican with the
nicety and reserve of the courtier ².’

the claims of persecuted worth are higher than those of relationship.
In ξ 8 he exaggerates the neamess of the connexion. Probably L.
Tubero, father of the accuser, had married a Tullia.
