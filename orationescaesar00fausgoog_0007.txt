PREFACE

—40—

Tms edition of the ‘ Orationes Caesarianae ' is designed
for use in the upper forms of ,schoolS‚ and cannot, pre-
tend to any originality in textual criticism‚ the text of
C. F. W. Miiller (1886) being accepted in all essentiaIS.
Some note has been taken, notwithstanding, of the valuable
results obtained by Mr. A. C. Clark from H, the Harleian
MS. 2682, which he finds to be closely connected with A,
Ambrosian MS. 29 (Xth cent), used by Miiller. No
scholar can study these speeches in future without the
help of his recent collation (in Anecd. Oxon. 1892).

Ι have used, for all three speeches, Richter's edition
edited by Eberhard (Leipzig, 1877): for the Marcellam,
referring also to Wolf, Worm‚ and Weiske: for the Li-
gariana, to an excellent edition by Strenge (Gotha, 1888)
as well as to Halm : for the pro rege Deiotar0‚ to the last-
named.

I am indebted to Dr. Evelyn Abbott, my former Tutor,
who revised the proofs of my work, for a leniency towards
its faults which I have experienced before 3 to Mr. J. H.
Fowler, of Manchester Grammar School, for similar assist-
ance3 and to my father for sundry notes and commentS.

A peculiar interest attaches to these speeches and con-
nects them naturally with one another. We see in them
the prince of Roman orators cautiously, and yet with
irresistible magic, asserting his power over the master of
the destinies of the Empire. The will of Caesar bows
before the genius of Cicer03 and we honour them both
the more for it.
