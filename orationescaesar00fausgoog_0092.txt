PRO Q. LIGARIO ORATIO.

sit, dubitative (deliberative) subj, R. 1610, P. V. 384. 2. So§ 24
dubitem ⁴? v. ibidem, n. on quamquam.

vidi et cognovi, ‘I know by my own observation.’ Cic. often
expresses one verbal notion by a couple of verbs (hendiadys) : so
ς 16 refellere et redarguere, ‘ completely refute.’

caueae, ‘claims’ ε viz. the merits of the case which they bring
before C.'s notice. Explained by the last line of this section.

vultus, ‘ familiar features.'

itaque . . . video tamen: another instance of co·ordination (in
Greek we should have μέν and δέ) for subordination: ‘ and so
although you bestow so many favours on your own friends, Ι see
neverthelesS.’ For tu quidem cp. n. on 5 30 ad init.

, quod soles, ‘ as is your wont,’ sc. considerare.

nosti optimos homines: in B.C. 82 Caesar, being mistrusted
by Sulla owing to his marriage with Cornelia, daughter of Cinna,
retired for safety to the country of the Sabines. [Codd. A H have
optime, with which cp. Deiot. ξ 23.]

, eapite, ‘ civil existence ἐ the whole complex of rights which

make up a man’s personality in the eye of the law. Cp. capitis

germanitas, ‘ neamess in blood,' answers (by a ‘chiasmus') to
fraterne, as lacrimae to cum dolore.

quae vicit, ‘ which won you the victory' 3 cp. Marcell. § 18.

noa omnes . . . essent: this was Pompeius' declaration in the
Senate when he left Rome at the outbreak of the war.

hune splendorem omnium:- hos omnes viros splendidos: n.
on Marcell. § 10. The epithet thus put arrests the attention: which
is the real explanation of ‘ transferred epithet‚’ as in ‘ haec vestis
priscis hominum variata figuris ² for pnlrcorum (Catull. 64, 50).
splendidus, stock epithet of equiteS, as amplus of senatorS, and
honestus of common citizens.

12. coi-fidium: he was already dead. This was pointed out to
Cic. by Brutus on behalf of T. Ligarius as a ‘ slip of the memory’
made in writing down the speech for publication3 and Cicero
asked Atticus to have it corrected in all the copies (ad Att. xiii.

qui adsunt, as advocati or witnesses to the character of the accused.

qui tecum morunt, only (of course) in the sense of ‘ qui contra
te non essent, tuos ' six lines above.
