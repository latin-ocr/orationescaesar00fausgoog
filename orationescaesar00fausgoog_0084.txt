. gesto etiam ex parte magna: the war began in January, 13.C. 49,

Cicero joined Pompeius in June, by which time Caesar was master
of Italy. Quintilian has observed that the orator here-disguises
flattery under an air of extreme outspokenness,(vrappvycria).

ad me ex Aegypto litteras misit ε after Pharsalus Cicero retired
to Brundisium, waited there in uncertainty as to Caesar's intentions
towards himself (November, B.C. 48, to September, 13.c. 47); about
June he received from him a letter which did not satisfy him (exigue
scripta ad Att. xi. 16), but in August another (satis liberales, ad Fam.
xiv. 23, letter to his wife) to which he probably here refers ;- and in
September, when Caesar lauded, he waited on him and was well
received.

oum ipse . . . passus θοις as proconsul of Cilicia, Cicero
gained some successes over the tribes of Mount Amanus, and was
saluted imperator by his troops, For this reason, after his return,
January 4, B.C. 49, he retained the laurente fasces and abstained
from entering the city, hoping for the triumph which never came,
until B.C. 47 (cp. Deiot. ξ 11). Caesar received the title of im-
perator for life (perpetuus) in B.C. 463 but he was allowed to use it
as a praenomen, and so the Emperors subsequently.
