PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO.

convey explicitly. So Phil. ii. 5 96 nos contemnendi, qui auctorem
odimus, acta defendimus ¹.

ξ 19, bono, as in summum bonum, a ‘ blessing ’ or ‘ possession.’

· ex quo . . . sapienti: the idea is the same as in Aristotle's
wordS, on the good man’s friendship with himself—‘ he desires to
live with himself: for the memories of his past actions are delightful
to him, and -the hopes of his future are good ' (Eth. N. ix. 4. 5).
Thus below, summa. bona. expresses the view of the Pefipatetics
sola of the Stoics.

avii-tute ε ‘as personified, R. 1221.

ᾧ 20. eupiditate, ξ 13 n. -

speeie . . . rei publicae, ‘ some vision of a free republie ’z
species generally objective‚ ‘ a semblance,’ here subjective, answering
as it does to opinione.

contraque, ‘ but rather ' ι aster the negative sentence ; the use of
a copulative instead of an adversative particle is common. Hor.
C. iii. 30. 6 non omnis moriar multaque pars mei Ι vitabit Libitinam.

ᾧ 21, nuno marks more distinctly than iam the introduction of a new

“ division in the speech, for its tempora] sense never leaves it. So
Quinct. ξ 91 nunc causa perorata etc„ where it marks the perora-
tion.

atrocissimam t cp. Deiot. 5 2, atrocissimum crimen, ⁴ formidable.'
The idea of ater ‘ lowering ’ (atra tempestas) is present in the word z
sometimes it means ‘ relentleSS,’ as in Verg. A. i. 662 urit a. Iun0,
Hor. C. ii. 1. 24 praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

The expression providenda est suspicio is severely criticised by
Wolf, but it is not unnatural in an extempore speech. It is, of
course, the occasion of the suspicion against which ‘precautions are
to be taken.’ Providenda= praecavenda.

spero with preS. infin. means ‘ believe,’ ‘trust‚' or. (as Lig. ξ 35
‘ feel sure’) unless the infin. verb contains in itself the idea of futurity‚
e-g. posse, appropinquare.

‘an ex hoo numero, qui una· tecum fuerunt ? is a corrected
statement of the question de tuisne ‘t' For the Ciceronian idiom ex
hoc n. qui fuerunt=ex horum n. q. f. ; cp. Deiot. § 24 ex eo numero
= ex eorum numero,

ullo: the oblique cases are sometimes substantival; v. exx. in R.
2279, 2280.

omnia summa, ‘ everything that can be thought of ’t de Orat. ii.
ς 85, cum o. ε. fecerit, tamen ad mediocris oratores esse venturus.
