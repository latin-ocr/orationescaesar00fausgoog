and construction be the equivalent of perfudit ‘ steeped,’ and that
thus memoria is nominative case. In Tac. Anu. xi. 31 we have eo
pavore offusum Claudium: of which the active form would be not
pavor offundit Claudium, but offundo Claudium eo pavore).

nobilissimamque faminam=et quorum ιι. f. Cp. n. on Deiot.
ς {Zia-xime et innumerabilibus, a positive adj. ean be coupled ᾗ ll.
with a superlative, if itself superi. in sense. Cp. Verr. ii. 4. 5 64
eximium ac pulcherrimum facinus.

gratulationibus= supplicationibus, ‘days of thanksgiving? In
Β. C. 57 the Senate decreed a supplicatio of fisteen days for Caesar‘s
victories in Gaul, in Β. ο. 55 and again Β. C. 52 others of twenty days
each3 in Β. ο. 46 another of forty days after his victory in Africa.
(In Catil. iv. 5 10 quaesitori gratulationem decrevit repeats mihi
supplicationem decrevit just above.)

illae quidem, cp. 5 9 note: idem, cp. 5 1 note.

florescit. we should have expected the ειιὶ)3., dependent on ᾗ 12,
ut above. the sense being‘ which is so great an achievement, that
whereas time must bring your trophies to an end. .this justice
and clemeney of yours enjoys a daily increasing renown.’ But the
parenthesis breaks the flow of the sentenceg and we have a sort of
anacoluthon3 natural enough in an impromptu speech. (The best
MSS. exhibit a well-meant correction, ut nulla tropaeis, etc.: on
which the conjecture, ut si ulla tropaeis . . . at haec . . . florescat,
is based).

detrahet . . . adterat: the same antithesis in Deiot. 5 1 (ubi v. n.).

laudibus: the plur. is preferred to the sing. laudi for the sake οἱ
correspondenoe with the plur. operibus: each opus has its own laus.
Cp. Hor. C. i. 6. 11 laudes egregii Caesaris, ‘ praises.' So supra
55 6, 10. Again (b) laudes sometimes ε ‘ praiseworthy deeds ⁹: v.
Deiot. 5 12, infra 5 30, or (c) ‘ praiseworthy qualities’ z quod omnis
laudes habet, id est optimum de opt. gen. or. 5 6.

vereor ut, R. 1652, K. 417n. 4„P. V. 397.

ipsam victoriam vicisse videris: victory, like fortune and
time, is sometimes represented as a personal force acting upon men,
not a mere bundle of circumstances. So Cic. can write. tu quid
doleat scribere audeS, nos ne id quidem tuto possumus, neque id
victoris vitio, sed ipsius victoriae, quac civilibus bellis semper est
insolens: ad Fam. iv. 4. 3.

occid-issemus, ‘ had perished,' lit. ε i.e. ‘ were as good as lost men!
’ reete unus invictus [es] ι several MSS. (as AH) omit es: it
scarcely suits with recte ι Miiller would rather supply diceris.
