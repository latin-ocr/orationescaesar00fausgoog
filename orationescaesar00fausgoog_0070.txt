PRO M. MARCELLO ORATIO.

quoted (cp. ad Fam. iv. 4, 3) se senatui roganti ne hominis quidem
causa (⁸ in consideration os the personal character of M.') negaturum.

illae is redundant, merely sharpening the antithesis of celebra-
buntur quidem with what follows (sed tamen, etc). Cp. infra 5
11: Lig. 5 30: Deiot. 5 27.

obstrepi clamore militum, ‘to be drowned by the eries of
battle.’ This persoual use of obstrepo in the passive is a ἅπαξ εἰρημένον
in Cicero.

ut . . velis, ‘ whose mind and thoughts we see reflected in your
face, how· you wish! Ut explains mentem sensusque, with which
os must be taken closely. Faernus conjectures sensusque eos needlessly.

parietes . . gratias agere gestiunt: a favourite hyperbole in
Cic„ ascribing emotion or utterance to inanimate nature. Cp.
Cluent. 5 15 (nonne timuisse) parietes ipsos, superiorum testes nupti-
arum : Mil. 5 20 the fields themselves mcum the loss of a beneficent
citizen. Common of course in poetry: cp. Hor. C. iv. 11. 6- “

ridet argento domus: ara castis
vincta verbenis avet immolato
spargier agn0.

ills auotoritas=vir illa auctoritate praeditus. referring to Mar·
cellus: ‘ his honoured presence? A strong instance of ‘ res pro
persona ⁹ (abstract for concrete). Cp. the well-known

virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli,
and ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο 2 there we find the original form of the idiom,
in which the genitive of the person is conjoined (v. infr. 5 13:
Lig. 5 33). Here the abstract noun by itself is so concrete that
suorum, suis refer to the person involved in it. Cp. Deiot. 5 30
a tanta auctoritate: Mil. 5 101 haec tanta virtus eq: hac urbe ex·

Ο. Marcell-i, own brother of Μ. Marcellus, consul Β. c, 49: it
has been supposed from Phil. xiii. 5 29 (which, however, does not
necessarily imply this), that he died soon after leaving Italy. Iu
ad Att. xv, 3 he is mentioned as alive in Β. C. 44. We need not there-
fore suppose that this optimus et amantissimus frater (infra 5 34) was
his first cousin CaiuS, cos. Β. C. 50.

omnium Marcellorum meum pectus memoria obfudit ε a very
strange expression if it stands as Cicero wrote it. We can say (e. g.)
oculis tenebras offundere ‘ to shed darkness on the eyes'3 and by an
inversion may say oculos tenebris offundere. Thus memoria is
the abl. ‘ C. Marcellus flooded my heart with memories of all the
Marcelli ' t a turgid metaphor‚ but lacrimas suggests it. (There is
absolutely nothing to support the view that obtudit can in sense
