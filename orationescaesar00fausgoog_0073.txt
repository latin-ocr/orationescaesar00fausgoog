NOTES: CHAP. JV. 5 13-VJ. 5 18.

prudens et sciens, ‘ with my eyes open.' So ad Fam. 1. c. ut in
fabulis Amphiaraus, sic ego prudens et sciens ‘ ad pestem ante oculos
positam ' sum profectus.

integra re, ‘ before the die was cast! Literal meaning of in· ᾗ 15,
teger? Cp. Lig. 5 1 n.

sensi, of political vieWS.

tam iniustus existimator rerum, ‘ so unfair in his judgments’ :
so 5 22 tam ignarus rerum, ‘so blind!

ceteris fuerit iti-atium we should subordinate instead of co-ordi·
nating: ‘ while he was very angry with the rest.’

qui . . . diligit, is . . . declarat, ‘in that he shows his esteem, he
declares) The causal subj. might have been used with qui. Cp.
what was said on 5 13, cum . . . conservavit. Here the actors are
identified, and thereby the acts.

haias . . . rei, sc. pacis auctorem fuisse. ᾗ 16,

certorum hominum, as in Deiot. 5 11, ‘of certain men who
shall be nameless ’τ such as L. Lentulus and L. Domitius Aheno·
barbus (Momms. iv. II. pp. 396-398‚ Momms abr. p. 460).

liberalitas, ⁸ handsome conduct’ ε liberalis properly expresses the
attributes of a ‘ free born citizen ’τ hence used (a) of generosity, in
giving, a regia laus (Deiot. 5 26) ε (b) of generous behaviour (e. g. to
opponents), as here and 5 19 infra, also Lig. 55 6, 23, 31: (c) of
‘ liberal pursuits ’ as opposed to servilia opera, liberalissima studia
pro Arch. 5 9.—The earlier sense ‘handsome in appearance ’ is
found in Plaut., e.g. pulcer et 1., Mil. Gl. i. 1. 60.

gladium vagina. vacuum, a sort of hypallage not unnatural in ᾗ 17.
extempore speaking. Corn. Nepos has vagina nudatum (Dat. xi. 4).
Cp. use of plenus in Sex. Rosc. 5 6 in pecuniam tam plenam in-
vaserit.

excita-et, twould raise‚' for the normal excitaturus fuerit: the
subj. may be said to do double duty here, as hypothetical and as
following quin: in such a case the substituted apodosis is usually
preferred (R. 1521, P. V. 5 4²0)· But the' construction may be
justified by the simple force of the imperf. ; si f. posset . . . excitabat,
‘ if it had been at the time possible, he was ready to raise‚‘

partis, how governed?

quidam enim, etc.: the letters belonging to the time of the ᾧ 18.
first civil war are full of this: even of Pompeius himself Cicero
says ‘ sullaturit animus eius et proscripturit iam diu ’ (ad Att. ix.
10. 6).

qui . . . excitaverunt, ‘ in that they raised ⁹ ε an indicative qui·
clause may tacitly convey a reason, which a subj. qui-clause would
