PRO MARCELLO.

his despair of the republic had suddenly given place to confidence in
her regenerator, his terror of proscription ² and feeling of isolation to
a sense of security and even dignity. This reaction of feeling
explains what there is of hyperbole and declamator-y emphasis in
the speech. What seems artificial (cp. supra 2), is really natural
in the highest degree. N o one claims for Cicero a faculty of political
prescienee. But ⁶ the eulogies which he showers upon Caesar, when
we remember his design in bestowing them, lose to some degree the
air of servility which has been made their reproach ²?

shake our faith by pointing out this and that flaw in its workman-

taken down by shorthand writers in the senate⁸z and exhibits a few
of the inaccuracies ⁴of improvisation. Again, it may have happened
that Cicero draughted in the rough a copy of his speech after making
it: and that for some reason (possibly the death of Marcellus or his
own subsequent attitude towards Caesar) he never gave it a final
revision for publication. Others—perhaps Tiro—may have pub-
lished it aster his death3 so that here and there the hand of another
may be traceable. It is significant that the exact title of the speech
is uncertain. But this fact tells against rather than for the ‘ pseud-
epigraphic ’ theory. In dealing with a similar question, Prof. Mahaffy
has remarked (Gk. Lit. ii. 340) ‘ how signally German critics have
their aesthetical judgments controlled by their critioel conclusione,
and in consequence how utterly unsafe they are as to questions of style?
