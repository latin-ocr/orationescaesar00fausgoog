PRO REGE DEIOTARO ORATIO.

This construction is here preferred to that of in or contra, because

the phrase thus answers to the stronger inimicitiae cum aliquo. ·

daturum fuisse, P. V. 5 428, R. 1784: n. on Lig. 5¹ 23·

aetatis, ‘ advanced age ἐ a neutral word defined by its context;
cp. valetudo, ‘ ill-health ’; fortuna, ‘ good fortune.’

amicitiae culpam, ‘ a slight imputation of disloyal friendship?
A gen. of apposition or definition (Ρ. V. 5 143, K. 5 248, R. 1302);
but the terseness of the expression cannot be reprodueed3 it is
equivalent to amicitiae neglectae culpam3 cp. Hom. Il. i. 93 οὔτ’
ἄρ’ ὅ ’γ’ εὐχωλῆς ἐπιμέμφεται οὔθ’ ἑκατόμβης, ‘ for the want osa vow.'

veto was vain), v. Momms. abr. p. 447, Momms. iv. ΙΙ. p. 359. It
was the ‘ ultimum decretum ’ of which the history of Catilina
furnishes an example (Sall. Catil. xxix): videant cosa, ne quid res
publica detrimenti capiat: and which gave to the consuls or whole
body of magistrates dictatorial powers.

ease effusam, ‘ had turned out in ssight?

Miffgnlnniinkenerc bellorum: cp. de imperio Cn. Pomp. (pro
