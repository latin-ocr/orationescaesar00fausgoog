part in the struggle3 in which Varus, Q. Metellus Scipio, and M.
Cato (Uticensis), aided by king J'uba of Numidia, commanded for
Pompeius, and M. Curio for Caesar. ‚After the battle of Thapsus
(April 6, B.C. 46) he received his life from Caesar, but without
permission to return to Rome. His brothers and friendS, Cicero in
particular, for some time exerted themselves in vain to procure this
for him. It was not unnatural that the conqueror should let those
obstinate foes wait for their pardon, who had kept him waiting so
long for their submission ². F inally, on September 2 3, 46, the Dic-
tator gave an audience to the intercessors. The brothers and
relatives fell at his feet 3 Cicero spoke for them. The reply given .
them was friendly but undecided ². Whatever hopes had been
aroused were however speedily dashed to the ground.. Q. Tubero
the younger preferred against Ligarius a charge of perduellio or
high treason‚ under a somewhat antiquated statute, in the Dictator's
court.

arms even aster the death of Pompeius, had taken the side of Juba a
foreign prince against the Roman people ⁸. Caesar sat in the Forum,
after the manner of the ancient kings, whose supreme jurisdiction he
now assumed ⁴. Such offences were usually tried before the quaestio
perpetua de maiestate 3 but at this time, as it appears from Suetonius ⁵,
there was no praetor in existence to preside in that court. No other
merely technical reason can be assigned for the choice of process
made by the accuser. It is evident from § 13 of the speech that the
sentence he asked was one of continued exile, not the death penalty,
which the full rigour of the law allowed: but the fact that the
defendant could not appear to plead his cause might well entitle him
to this much consideration. .

The case came into court probably before the end of Β. e. 46,
certainly before Caesar's departure for Spain. The friends of Ligarius
